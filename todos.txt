Word -> any word of the pattern
Any -> when I have splits of | ex: |some|all|none
Sequence -> Any grouping > 1 elements
Optional -> when using ?
Repeat -> !!!!!!!
TypeName -> gotta check pre word and nth split
DefContainer -> how to identify is trick
MathPattern -> how to identify is all tricky
OptRepeat -> !!

MathPattern -> TerminalSymbol -> just a symbol
Function -> any operation of expressions
Expression -> any expressions.


suggestion to maybe think about restructing the patterns in a way that helps.
