The `install-jdk` library is a Python package that simplifies the process of installing OpenJDK on Windows, macOS, Linux and other supported operating systems, saving time and effort. `install-jdk` is a useful tool for users, developers, and system administrators who need to set up Java development environment or runtime in an automated and repeatedable fashion.

`install-jdk` has no third-party dependencies and depends solely on the standard libraries found in Python3. This means that you can easily install and use the library without having to install any additional dependencies.

`install-jdk` aims to provide as many options as possible to install an OpenJDK Java version across a wide array of operating systems and architectures. Please see each vendors OpenJDK documentation to see what operating systems and architectures they support.

install-jdk will do its best to detect the operating system and architecture that it is running on. Currently is able to detect:

- Operating Systems

  - Windows
  - Linux
  - MacOS
  - AIX

- Architecture
  - arm
  - aarch64
  - ppc64
  - x64
  - x86

## Installation

To install the install-jdk library, simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install install-jdk
```

## Usage

To use the `install-jdk` library, import it into your Python code:

```python
import jdk
```

The library provides an `install` function, which takes the following parameters:

- `version` - The major version of the Java OpenJDK build to install (e.g. 8, 11, 17, etc.).
- `operating_system` - The target operating system. If not specified, will use the user's detected operating system if possible.
- `arch` - The target architecure. If not specified, will use the user's detected architecture if possible.
- `impl` - The Java implementation to use. Currently only supports `HOTSPOT` and dependent on the OpenJDK Build Vendor.
- `jre` - A boolean value indicating that the Java Runtime Environment should be installed. Defaults to false, which will install the Java Development Kit.
- `path` - The location to install the downloaded OpenJDK build. If not specified, will install into `$HOME/.jdk/<VERSION>` for the Java Development Kit and `$HOME/.jre/<VERSION>` for the Java Runtime Environment.
- `vendor` - The vendor to download the OpenJDK build from. If not specified, defaults to [Adoptium](https://adoptium.com). This is a named argument so must be provided like `vendor='Corretto'`. Please see the list of [Supported OpenJDK Build Vendors](#supported-openjdk-build-vendors)

Here are some example code snippet:

```python
jdk.install('11')
# Platform dependent install of Java JDK 11 into $HOME/.jdk/<VERSION>

jdk.install('11', jre=True)
# Platform dependent install of Java JRE 11 into $HOME/.jre/<VERSION>

jdk.install('17', vendor='Corretto')
# Installs a Corretto build of Java 17 JDK. Defualt vendor is Adoptium

jdk.install('17', vendor='Corretto', path='/usr/local/jdk')
# Installs a Corretto build of Java 17 JDK into /usr/local/jdk
```

The library also has a `get_download_url` function that returns the URL for the given version, it takes the following parameters:

- `version` - The major version of the Java OpenJDK build to install (e.g. 8, 11, 17, etc.).
- `operating_system` - The target operating system. If not specified, will use the user's detected operating system if possible.
- `arch` - The target architecure. If not specified, will use the user's detected architecture if possible.
- `impl` - The Java implementation to use. Currently only supports `HOTSPOT` and dependent on the OpenJDK Build Vendor.
- `jre` - A boolean value indicating that the Java Runtime Environment should be installed. Defaults to false, which will install the Java Development Kit.
- `vendor` - The vendor to download the OpenJDK build from. If not specified, defaults to [Adoptium](https://adoptium.com). This is a named argument so must be provided like `vendor='Corretto'`. Please see the list of [Supported OpenJDK Build Vendors](#supported-openjdk-build-vendors)

Here are some example code snippets:

```python
from jdk.enums import OperatingSystem, Architecture

download_url = jdk.get_download_url('17', jre=True)
print(download_url)
# Obtains the platform dependent JRE download url

download_url = jdk.get_download_url('17', operating_system=OperatingSystem.LINUX, arch=Architecure.AARCH64, vendor='Corretto')
print(download_url)
# Obtains OpenJDK 17 from Corretto for Linux running on aarch64
```

The library has a `download` function that will download the requested version and returns back the path to where it was downloaded. This function does not currently support overriding the default download path which is the operating systems specific TMP directory. It takes the following parameters.

- `download_url` - The URL to the file to be downloaded. Defaults to None.
  - - `version` - Required when `download_version` is None and must be provided as a named parameter. The major version of the Java OpenJDK build to install (e.g. 8, 11, 17, etc.).
- `operating_system` - Must be provided as a named parameter. The target operating system. If not specified, will use the user's detected operating system if possible.
- `arch` - Must be provided as a named parameter. The target architecure. If not specified, will use the user's detected architecture if possible.
- `impl` - Must be provided as a named parameter. The Java implementation to use. Currently only supports `HOTSPOT` and dependent on the OpenJDK Build Vendor.
- `jre` - Must be provided as a named parameter. A boolean value indicating that the Java Runtime Environment should be installed. Defaults to false, which will install the Java Development Kit.
- `vendor` - The vendor to download the OpenJDK build from. If not specified, defaults to [Adoptium](https://adoptium.com). This is a named argument so must be provided like `vendor='Corretto'`. Please see the list of [Supported OpenJDK Build Vendors](#supported-openjdk-build-vendors)

Here are some example code snippets:

```python
from jdk.enums import OperatingSystem, Architecture

download_file = jdk.download('https://api.adoptium.net/v3/binary/latest/17/ga/windows/x64/jdk/hotspot/normal/eclipse')
print(download_file)
# Downloads the requested file and returns back the TMP locations it was stored in.

download_file = jdk.download(version='17', operating_system=OperatingSystem.LINUX, arch=Architecure.AARCH64, vendor='Corretto')
print(download_file)
# Downloads the a Linux aarch64 build of Java 17 from Corretto and returns back the TMP location it was stored in.
```

The library also provided two helper properties that can be used to see what it detected as the user's operating system and architecture.

```python
print(jdk.OS)
print(jdk.ARCH)
```
