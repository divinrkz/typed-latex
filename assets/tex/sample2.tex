% This is a simple sample document.  For more complicated documents take a look in the exercise tab. Note that everything that comes after a % symbol is treated as comment and ignored when the code is compiled.

\documentclass{article} % \documentclass{} is the first command in any LaTeX code.  It is used to define what kind of document you are creating such as an article or a book, and begins the document preamble

\usepackage{amsmath} % \usepackage is a command that allows you to add functionality to your LaTeX code

\title{Sample 2} % Sets article title
\author{My Name} % Sets authors name
\date{\today} % Sets date for date compiled
\begin{something}
    let $x \in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{something}
% The preamble ends with the command \begin{document}
\begin{document} % All begin commands must be paired with an end command somewhere
    consider $x \gte 4{N}$. 
\end{document} % This is the end of the document
