\section*{Proof}

\textbf{Theorem:} For any integer $a$, if $a \leq b$, then $a + c \leq b + c$ for any integer $c$.

\textbf{Proof:}

Let $a, b,$ and $c$ be arbitrary integers such that $a \leq b$. We need to show that $a + c \leq b + c$.

Given $a \leq b$, we can add the integer $c$ to both sides of the inequality:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        a + c \leq b + c
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

This follows from the basic properties of inequalities, where adding the same number to both sides of an inequality preserves the inequality.

Thus, we have shown that if $a \leq b$, then $a + c \leq b + c$ for any integer $c$. \n

This just a line to add all the inequalities Let $x = 3$ and $y = 4$. So, $x \neq y$. Also, we could say $y > x$ and $y \geq x$ is also valid.

Also, $n = m = p$ and $0 < x < 16$ and for $ y \in \mathbb{N}$

$a \leq b \geq c < d$
