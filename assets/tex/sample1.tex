\textbf{Theorem}: The sum of two even numbers is even.

\textbf{Proof}: Let $a$ and $b$ be two even numbers. By definition of even numbers, there exist integers $k_1$ and $k_2$ such that:

$a = 2k_1 \quad \text{and} \quad b = 2k_2$

Now, consider the sum of $a$ and $b$:

$a + b = 2k_1 + 2k_2 = 2(k_1 + k_2)$

Since $k_1 + k_2$ is an integer, it follows that $a + b$ is divisible by 2. Therefore, $a + b$ is even.
